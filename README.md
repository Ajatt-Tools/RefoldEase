Sets the `Ease factor` of all the cards in your collection to the value you choose,
and updates `Interval Modifier` and `Starting Ease` in every option group.
Inspired by [ResetEZ](https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/anki/low-key-anki/low-key-anki-summary-and-installation/).

The addon is intended for people who want to switch from default Anki settings
to the setup recommended on the [Refold site](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/a/anki-setup).
If you've been using Anki for a while, simply changing the settings won't help
because all your cards would still retain their Ease factors.
The only way to reset Ease factors of your cards is to use an external tool.
If you have used Refold settings from the beginning, this add-on is not needed.
The other feature of this add-on is to undo damage that was caused by overusing the "hard" button,
in other words, to swiftly escape from "ease hell."

You can run the add-on by going to `Tools > Refold Ease`.
