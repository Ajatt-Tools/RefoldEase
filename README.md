Sets the ease factor of all the cards in your collection to the value you choose,
and updates `Interval Modifier` and `Starting Ease` in every option group.
Inspired by [ResetEZ](https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/anki/low-key-anki/low-key-anki-summary-and-installation/).

You can run the add-on by going to `Tools -> Refold Ease`.

There are two uses for this add-on.
The first is to undo damage that was caused by overusing the "hard" button
prior to adopting the [Low-Key Anki](https://massimmersionapproach.com/table-of-contents/anki/low-key-anki/intro) setup.
In other words, to swiftly escape from "ease hell."
The other use concerns using Anki on mobile devices.
Check the `Force sync in one direction` checkbox if you notice
that the updated ease values aren't getting pushed from desktop to AnkiWeb.
